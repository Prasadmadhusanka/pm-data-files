Multiple trees can be arranged within a plot using uniform or random placement strategies while enforcing spatial constraints. The system provides interactive 3D and 2D visualizations using Plotly and supports data export to JSON and CSV formats, making it easy to integrate into reproducible scientific workflows.",
