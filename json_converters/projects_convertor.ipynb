All geographic information for the 100 cities and 16 federal states is stored as GeoJSON documents within the database. The system is fully automated using Python for data ingestion and processing, with GitHub Actions handling scheduled execution. In addition to real-time data, the pipeline maintains historical weather records, enabling use cases such as dashboards, REST or GraphQL API development, analytics, and weather forecasting projects.',\n",
